Optimizing any app for Cloud Run requires a balance of different aspects to be considered, therefore it is important to always have a clear picture of **what it is that you are optimizing for**:
* start-up time
* execution latency
* resource consumption (memory & CPU)
* concurrency
* image size
* easy maintainability
* lower costs
