# Custom Commands - Explain, Plan, Implement, Deploy

This folder is a collection of custom commands for the [Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)

## üöÄ How to Use

You can install these configurations globally for all projects or locally for a single project.

**Global Installation:**

Copy the `commands` folder from the [repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/serverless-production-readiness-java-gcp/tree/main/genai/gemini-cli-extensions/commands) to the root folder of your machine under `~/.gemini/commands/`
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/serverless-production-readiness-java-gcp.git ~/.gemini-tmp && 
rsync -av ~/.gemini-tmp/genai/gemini-cli-extensions/commands/ ~/.gemini/commands && rm -rf ~/.gemini-tmp
```

**Project-Specific Installation:**

Copy the `commands` folder from the [repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/serverless-production-readiness-java-gcp/tree/main/genai/gemini-cli-extensions/commands) to the `.gemini/commands/` folder of your project.
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/serverless-production-readiness-java-gcp.git .gemini-tmp && 
rsync -av .gemini-tmp/genai/gemini-cli-extensions/commands/ ./.gemini/commands && rm -rf .gemini-tmp
```

**Note:** Both methods may overwrite existing configuration files with the same name.

## üõ†Ô∏è Custom Commands
