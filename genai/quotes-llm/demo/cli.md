PLAN to generate a quoteByBook method in QuoteEndpoint, handle the error codes from the QuotesService and return the error codes to the UI, including the dependent calls downstream. Respond with the plan, but DO NOT execute it     
```

```
 revisit the plan: I am interested only in adding the proper method in QuoteEndpoint however not the controller.  Do not modify the frontend      
```

```
plan on adding also the appropriate tests for the QuoteEndpoint, the service and the repository class
```

```
Use deploy mode and generate a file explaining step-by-step how to build and deploy this project to cloud run using a dockerfile and artifact registry
```

You are an expert software architect specialized in Gemini CLI. I want to generate a DEPLOY.md which should have the DEPLOY role and structured similar        │
│   to PLAN, EXPLAIN and IMPLEMENT. The DEPLOY mode can't be entered until the IMPLEMENT mode has been entered and executed. Sucess criteria should include        │
│   building Spring Boot applications with Dockerfiles and Cloud Native Buildpacks, store in Artifact Registry and deploy to Cloud Run, while setting all          │
│   environment variables    
```
